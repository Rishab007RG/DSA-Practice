Recursion:
* It's mandatory that time and space complexity reduces
* More readable format
* Efficient approach (Implementation is easy compared to looping statements)

* When function call itself
* Base condition is must (terminating condition): if not present the method undergoes infinite loop
* Used to solve bigger problems after breaking it down into smaller problems
* Iterative problem to Recursive problem

Recursion Tracking can be done in 2 ways:
1. Stack
2. Tree

1.Stack
* main() stores first in the stack.
* Activation record
* Instruction point

Binary Tree Implementation in Two ways:
* Array
* LinkedList

Binary Tree Traversal
* 1st Preorder (NLR)
* 2nd Inorder (LNR) Left most node of the tree
* 3rd Postorder (LRN) Left most node of the tree

Construct Binary Tree from Preorder, Inorder, Postorder
