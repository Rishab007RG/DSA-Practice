Hashing: It is a process of mapping a large amount of data items to a smaller table with the help of hash function.
* The data will be of Arbitrary size ,Hash table will be of fixed size.

Hash Function:
a.Division Method: (%) reminder value of a number
b. Mid square Method : square a number and fetch the middle value

Collision resolution techniques:
When two elements get the same hash index.
a.Seperate Chaining: storing the data in the form of LinkedList in each cell.
  disadvantages: Memory wastage due to pointer occupying space.
b.Open Addressing:
* Probing:The process of examining the location for the key in order to store the data in the hashtable.
  a. Linear Probing:
  b. Quadratic Probing:
  c. Double Hashing Probing:

a.Linear Probing:
L(k,i)=(h'(k)+i)mod m.
h'(k)=k mod m.
m=size of hashtable
k=key
i=0 to (m-1)
disadvantage:
* Clustering:Clustering happens when many elements get stored close together in a hash table because of collisions.
* Searching O(n) :This disadvantage is over come by "Quadratic Probing".

b.Quadratic Probing:
L(k,i)=(h'(k)+C1i+C2i^2)mod m.
C1,C2 = Constants: generally can assume anything but preferred as "C1=C2=1"
m=size of hashtable

c.Double Hashing
L(k,i)=(h1(k)+ih2(k))mod m
h1(k)=k mod m.
h2(k)=k mod m'.
m'<m
