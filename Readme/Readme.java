    /* Array: In array each index/block is 4 bytes.
    ex: If an array has a length of 10 than its space is 40 bytes hence the data is stored where the system as 40bytes of space.

    Types of Array
    a. 1D Array
    b. 2D Array4
    c. Multi-D Array

    Advantages
    * allows contiguous memory.
    * Access time T(n)=O(i)
    * Can store multiple data of same type in a single variable

    Disadvantage
    * Insertion time complexity T(0)=O(0)
    * Deletion time complexity T(0)=O(0)
    * Size of the array should be known in advance
    * Wastage of memory if the data is not store as the per the size of the array

    Application of Array
    Searching; Sorting; Matrix Operation; Image Processing; Can implement Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph

    /*
    LinkList
    * Linear Data Structure.

    Advantages
    * Non-contiguous memory allocation.
    * No need to initialize the number(size) of elements to be added.

    Disadvantages
    * Access time complexity is more.
    * More memory space is required.

    Types of LinkList
    * Singly LinkList.
    * Circular LinkList.
    * Doubly LinkList.
